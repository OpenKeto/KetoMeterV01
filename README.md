# KetoMeterV01

This is a very simple test Keto Meter.

# Hardware

This meter is based on an Arduino and a MQ3 Alcohol Sensor.

The MQ3 sensor is a couple of dollars shipped from China and can be found on ebay.

# Software

The software is also minimal. It consists of a menu system which allows the display to be viewed on a small TFT display.
